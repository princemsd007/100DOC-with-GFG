Given Preorder, Inorder and Postorder traversals of some tree of size N. The task is to check if they are all of the same tree or not.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
preorder[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 3}
inorder[] = {4, 2, 5, 1, 3}
postorder[] = {4, 5, 2, 3, 1}
Output: Yes
Explanation: 
All of the above three traversals 
are of the same tree.
           1
         /   \
        2     3
      /   \
     4     5
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
preorder[] = {1, 5, 4, 2, 3}
inorder[] = {4, 2, 5, 1, 3}
postorder[] = {4, 1, 2, 3, 5}
Output: No
Explanation: The three traversals can 
not be of the same tree.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function checktree() which takes the array preorder[ ], inorder[ ], postorder[ ] and integer N as input parameters and returns true if the three traversals are of the same tree or not. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 103
Node values are unique.
