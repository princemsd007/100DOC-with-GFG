Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. The task is to find the element that would be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kthElement() which takes the arrays arr1[], arr2[], its size N and M respectively and an integer K as inputs and returns the element at the Kth position.


Expected Time Complexity: O(Log(N) + Log(M))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log (N))


Constraints:
1 <= N, M <= 106
1 <= arr1i, arr2i < INT_MAX
1 <= K <= N+M
